## üí° How to Use

1.  **Access the application:** Simply open the [Live Demo link](https://smyhlin.github.io/fallout-mods-manager/) provided above.
2.  **Mark modules:** Use the checkbox (üí°) in the first column (or at the top of the card on mobile) to mark modules as learned.
3.  **Filter/Sort/Search:** Use the controls in the sidebar (accessible via the ‚öôÔ∏è button on mobile) to filter, sort, and search the module list.
4.  **Customize View:** Adjust column visibility and width (on desktop) via the sidebar settings.
5.  **Add/Edit/Delete:** Use the form at the bottom to add new modules, or use the ‚úèÔ∏è/üóëÔ∏è icons next to each module (in the "–î—ñ—ó" column on desktop, or top-right on mobile cards) to edit or delete.
6.  **Import/Export:** Use the buttons in the sidebar to save your data to a file or load data from a backup.

**Important Note:** All data is stored **locally in your browser's `localStorage`**. Clearing your browser data will erase your saved modules and settings. Use the Export feature to create backups. Data is not shared between different browsers or devices.

## üîÆ Future Improvements (Ideas)

*   User accounts and cloud synchronization (would require a backend).
*   Ability to track modules per character.
*   More detailed filtering options (e.g., by weapon/armor type if data allows).
