## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

This application is designed to be plug-and-play. No complex installation is needed.

1.  **Download or Clone the Repository:**
    * You can download the project files as a ZIP archive and extract them to a folder on your computer.
    * Alternatively, if you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://your-repository-url/fallout-mods-manager.git
        cd fallout-mods-manager
        ```

2.  **Serve `index.html` via an HTTP Server:**
    * To ensure all features, especially language localization from local JSON files, work correctly, you need to serve the `index.html` file through a simple HTTP server. Opening `index.html` directly from your file system (e.g., `file:///...`) might lead to issues due to browser security policies (CORS).
    * Here are a few common ways to do this:
        * **Using Python (if installed):**
            Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory (where `index.html` is located), and run one of the following commands:
            * For Python 3: `python -m http.server`
            * For Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
            Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port number shown in the terminal).
        * **Using VS Code with the "Live Server" Extension:**
            If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension. Once installed, right-click on the `index.html` file in the VS Code explorer and select "Open with Live Server."
        * **Using `npx serve` (if you have Node.js/npm installed for other development purposes):**
            Open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and run:
            ```bash
            npx serve
            ```
            Then, open the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5000`).
        * **Other HTTP Server Tools:** Many other simple static file server tools are available.

Once the server is running, navigate to the provided local URL in your web browser to use the application.

## üìñ How to Use

3.  Select active perks that influence critical hits.

## üåê Localization

The application supports multiple languages. You can switch the display language through the settings panel. If you'd like to contribute translations for a new language:
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Duplicate the `locales/en.json` (and `en_modules.json` if applicable) file and rename it to your language code (e.g., `de.json` for German).
3.  Translate the values in your new JSON file.
4.  Update the language context and language switcher component to include the new language.
5.  Submit a pull request with your changes.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! If you have suggestions for improvements, new features, or bug fixes, please follow these steps:

*(Note: The application is completely self-contained and requires no build tools or dependencies. You only need a basic HTTP server to run it locally or GitHub Pages for hosting.)*

1.  **Fork the Project.**
2.  **Create your Feature Branch:** (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3.  **Commit your Changes:** (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4.  **Push to the Branch:** (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
