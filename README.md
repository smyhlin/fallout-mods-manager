*   **Custom Module Management:**
    *   **Add:** Add your own custom modules that might not be in the default list.
    *   **Edit:** Modify the Editor ID and Effect of any module (Name and Stars are locked for predefined modules to maintain data integrity). Edits are performed via a convenient modal window.
    *   **Delete:** Remove any module (predefined or custom) with a confirmation prompt.
*   **Filtering & Sorting:**
    *   **Filter:** View "All", "Learned", or "Not Learned" modules.
    *   **Sort:** Click on column headers (üí°, –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ –ù–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ, Editor ID, –ó–≤—ë–∑–¥—ã, –≠—Ñ—Ñ–µ–∫—Ç) to sort the list ascending or descending.
*   **Text Search:** Instantly filter modules by typing parts of the Russian Name, Editor ID, or Effect text. Matching text is highlighted.
*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   **Desktop:** Classic table view with customizable column visibility and width.

    *   Adjust the width of resizable columns using sliders in the sidebar.
    *   Settings are saved locally.

*   **Data Persistence:** Your module list (learned status, custom modules) and view settings (column visibility/width) are automatically saved in your browser's `localStorage`.
*   **Import/Export:** Backup your data (modules and settings) to a JSON file or import data from a previously exported file. Useful for transferring data or keeping backups.
*   **Statistics:** See a quick overview of total modules, learned count, and percentage learned in the sidebar.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Access the application:** Simply open the [Live Demo link](https://s_myhlin.github.io/fallout-mods-manager/) provided above.
2.  **Mark modules:** Use the checkbox (üí°) in the first column (or at the top of the card on mobile) to mark modules as learned.
3.  **Filter/Sort/Search:** Use the controls in the sidebar (accessible via the ‚öôÔ∏è button on mobile) to filter, sort, and search the module list.
4.  **Customize View:** Adjust column visibility and width (on desktop) via the sidebar settings.
5.  **Add/Edit/Delete:** Use the form at the bottom to add new modules, or use the ‚úèÔ∏è/üóëÔ∏è icons next to each module (in the "–î—ñ—ó" column on desktop, or top-right on mobile cards) to edit or delete.
6.  **Import/Export:** Use the buttons in the sidebar to save your data to a file or load data from a backup.

**Important Note:** All data is stored **locally in your browser's `localStorage`**. Clearing your browser data will erase your saved modules and settings. Use the Export feature to create backups. Data is not shared between different browsers or devices.

## üîÆ Future Improvements (Ideas)

*   User accounts and cloud synchronization (would require a backend).
*   Ability to track modules per character.
*   More detailed filtering options (e.g., by weapon/armor type if data allows).
*   Improved accessibility audit.
*   Refactoring into separate JS/CSS files and adding a build step (Vite, Parcel).
